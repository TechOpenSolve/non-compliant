# Repository for non-compliant Issue submissions

This repository serves as a designated space for issues that have not been submitted in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md) file. 

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide a place for issues that do not adhere to the guidelines specified in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md) file. 

The [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md) is the same for every repo in the project apart from the TechOpenSolve repo that holds the code for the website.

Issues that fail to follow the outlined procedures will be moved here.

## Non-Compliance Reasons

The most common reason for non-compliance is the failure to follow Step 2 outlined in the contributing document. This step requires the following:

- Opening a discussion related to the proposed issue.
- Obtaining approval for the issue.
- Agreeing upon the appropriate repository for the issue.

Failure to adhere to these steps may result in the issue being deemed non-compliant and moved to this repository.

## Issues in this repository do not appear on the TechOpenSolve website.

Since compliance is important, not all submitted issues can be displayed on the website without proper approval.

We appreciate your cooperation in maintaining the quality and organization of our issue tracking system. By following the guidelines outlined in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md), you contribute to a more efficient and effective collaboration process.
